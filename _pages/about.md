My name is Danya Pradeep and I am a first year Ph.D Student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Arizona. My advisor is Professor Jeffrey Rodriguez.

## My research interests

I am interested in Signal Processing, Image and Video Processing and Medical Imaging. I am especially interested in abnormality/disease detection from medical images. I have worked on Retinal Macular Edema Detection from Optical Coherence Tomographic Images for my master's project dissertation. Currently, I am working in a Cardio Toxicity Assay Platform project studying synthetic cardiac grafts seeded with human fibroblast stem-cells and cardio-myocytes.

## My background

I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering and a master's degree in Biomedical Signal Processing and Instrumentation.
